1) BUILD INSTRUCTIONS. _________________________________________________________

	Please make sure to copy $PROJECT_DIRECOTRY/res/sound/* to
	$RUN_DIRECTORY/sound/* after building.


2) ANNOTATED RUBRIC. ___________________________________________________________

Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] All engine features from Final1 are polished and ready for usage

    They are all ready for usage, though I do plan on adding more features if I
    need them.

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] The player constantly moves forward on a rail (can be just straight
    forward)

    The way this works is that all entities are offset by the player's
    position, such that the player always remains at the origin.

[ ] At least two distinct, killable enemy types

    The cubes and diamonds are quite different (apart from being simple
    polyhedra).

[ ] Some semblance of a defense mechanic exists (does not need to be fully
    implemented)

    I am experimenting with how the defense system is displayed and I am going
    to change it from the current one; however I ran out of time to change it.
    Additionally, some mechanics of the defense ring, such as it being disabled
    if you fail to block anything by pressing a defense button, have not been
    implemented yet.

[ ] A score is displayed on the screen that is updated when enemies die, other
    events happen, etc.

    Please see the upper-right corner of the screen.

[ ] Score is somehow calculated using a combination of rhythm and user input

    Score gain is based on the base value of an enemy times the current combo
    you have.  Combo increases if you press shoot (LMB or S) on the beat of the
    music. It decreases if you press it off the beat, or you hold down the
    shoot button.

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an
    INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify
    requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the
    specific handout


3) KNOWN BUGS. _________________________________________________________________

    None known.


4) TIME SPENT. _________________________________________________________________

    Too many hours.
