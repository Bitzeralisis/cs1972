                  CHAPTER 0: A SONG OF SKY AND SORROW -SoSaS-

                                indev version 3

1) ANNOTATED RUBRIC. ___________________________________________________________

COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE

Retries used: NONE (2 extra retries left)

[ ] Completed a design check
[ ] Participated in playtesting

Voxel Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Analytic voxel-based raycasting
[ ] Automated chunk streaming 
    [ ] Chunks within a certain distance of a selected focus point are
        automatically loaded into the game
    [ ] Loaded chunks outside a certain distance are unloaded from the game

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Addition and removal of blocks
    [ ] Ray shot from the camera eye extending along the look vector
    [ ] Visual highlighting of the nearest intersected face
    [ ] Targeted block can be removed
    [ ] Block can be added to the empty block adjacent to the targeted face
    [ ] Addition or removal of blocks updates the appropriate VBO's
[ ] Continuous chunk streaming
    [ ] Chunks within 2 chunks of the player must be in memory
    [ ] Chunks further than this distance must be unloaded from memory (you do
        not need to save changes to unloaded chunks)
    [ ] Initialization of newly visible chunks must be spread across multiple
        frames or performed in a separate thread
[ ] Simplistic enemies
    [ ] Spawn either at the beginning of the game or at intervals during play
    [ ] Collide and interact with both the world and the player
    [ ] No complex AI required, but cannot remain stationary or jump in place
[ ] It must be possible to restart the game without quitting the program
[ ] The game must have at least two screens

Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an
    INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify
    requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the specific
    handout


2) KNOWN BUGS. _________________________________________________________________

None known.


3) TIME SPENT. _________________________________________________________________
