Game Requirements
========================================

    navigation mesh

    The red ellipsoids pathfind, but resort to running in a straight line and
    jumping if they cannot find a path.

    condition

    Defeat the boss to win; lose all health to die.

[ ] The game must be resettable upon win or loss without restarting the program
