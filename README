                                Children of Gaia

1) BUILD INSTRUCTIONS. _________________________________________________________

	Please make sure to copy $PROJECT_DIRECOTRY/res/sound/* to
	$RUN_DIRECTORY/sound/* after building.


2) ANNOTATED RUBRIC. ___________________________________________________________

COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE

Retries used: NONE (2 extra retries left)

Engine Requirements
========================================
[ ] Supports playback of short sound clips and long music files

	Please see src/engine/audio.*. I also additionally support setting a sound
	as the background music track, and queueing sounds to play on specific
	times in the future with sample precision (as provided by FMOD).

[ ] Bloom lighting

	Please see src/engine/graphics/bloommodule.*. I extract parts of the screen
	that are very bright from an HDR texture, blur it, and blend it back to the
	screen. The blur is a horizontal/vertical separated 33x33 kernel that
	samples textures in between texels to save on texture fetches.

[ ] Particle systems that are updated/drawn on the GPU

	Please see src/engine/graphics/particlemodule.*. The particles are both
	drawn and updated on the GPU. Particle data, such as position, life, and
	velocity, are represented as floats in textures, and a special shader
	performs the particle physics. Particles are drawn as an array of points
	which are used to index into particles in the particle textures, then
	turned into billboarded quads by a geometry shader. My particles obey depth
	and are additively blended.

Game Requirements
========================================
[ ] Has at least 2 distinct sound effects that can be triggered on command

	The clap sound effect plays immediately on clicking, and the tick sound
	effect plays once every 16th beat aligned to 16th beats as long as the
	mouse is held (and a bit after).

[ ] Has some form of background music

	Yes.

[ ] Demonstrates bloom lighting with at least one light source

	Yes. Please see the glowing cubes in the corners, or just spawn a bunch of
	particles and watch as they cause bloom to happen.

[ ] Demonstrates usage of at least 1000 particles simultaneously

	I've set up my particle system to do up to 2^16 (32K) particles. While
	holding the mouse down, each cube is approximately 2000 particles.


Global requirements
========================================
[ ] Top-level handin directory contains a Qt project file, a README, and an
    INSTRUCTIONS file
[ ] README has a copy of the rubric with explanations of how to verify
    requirements
[ ] README documents any known bugs
[ ] README indicates number of hours taken
[ ] INSTRUCTIONS contains all information needed to play the game
[ ] Engine and game code logically separated
[ ] Engine code well designed
[ ] Game code well designed
[ ] Runs on department machines
[ ] Does not crash
[ ] Works at 800x600 and fullscreen resolutions
[ ] Runs at 30+ UPS and never dips below 20 UPS unless indicated in the
    specific handout

	Hopefully...


3) KNOWN BUGS. _________________________________________________________________

    None known.


4) TIME SPENT. _________________________________________________________________

    Too many hours.
