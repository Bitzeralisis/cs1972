                    GRASSDASH II: THE BEYOND OF DIMENSION V
                  CHAPTER 0: A SONG OF SKY AND SORROW -SoSaS-

                                indev version 3

1) OVERVIEW. ___________________________________________________________________

    The GRASSDASHER, hit by ROBOCYLINDER's d-beam, has been transported to a
    strange BEYOND known only as DIMENSION V. To escape, the GRASSDASHER must
    learn to harness the strange power of CHAOS and fight back the endless
    hordes of CHAOS BEINGS. But DIMENSION V reveals secrets to the GRASSDASHER
    that cylinder-kind was never meant to know. Will the GRASSDASHER be able to
    escape? And how will the GRASSDASHER cope with those dark secrets?


2) HOW TO PLAY. ________________________________________________________________

    Collect 4 CHAOS CUBES and survive CHAOS TIME to win. You lose if you lose
    all your health.

    Use the compass in the lower-right to find CHAOS CUBES.
    
    The CHAOS CLOCK will fill up faster the more CHAOS CUBES you collect; when
    the CHAOS CLOCK fills up, CHAOS TIME will begin.

    During CHAOS TIME, you will slowly lose health. Defeat CHAOS BEINGS in order
    to exit CHAOS TIME.


3) CONTROLS. ___________________________________________________________________

    REGULAR CONTROLS

        Mouse > Look
        WASD  > Walk
        Space > Jump

    NORMAL ABILITIES

        Normal abilities use energy (green gauge). If you use up all your
        energy, you will become energy-locked (gray gauge) and cannot use normal
        abilities until your energy fully recovers.

        Left-click   > Attack. Hits one enemy. Low energy cost.
        Right-click  > Dig or Place block. High energy cost. Places block when
                       dirt meter (brown) is full; digs otherwise.
        Shift (hold) > Dash mode. Low energy cost. Changes Walk to Dash, and
                       Jump to Dash-jump.

    CHAOS POWERS

        Chaos powers use chaos energy (purple gauge). You gain more chaos powers
        and max chaos energy as you collect CHAOS CUBES. Chaos energy only
        regenerates if you do not use a chaos power for a short time.

        Alt+Left-click  > CHAOS BOLT. Requires level 2. Shoots one projectile.
                          Low chaos energy cost.
        Alt+Right-click > CHAOS FLARE. Requires level 3. Shoots a chaos flare
                          that fires multiple chaos bolts. High chaos energy
                          cost.


4) ALEX'S IDOL CORNER. _________________________________________________________

    Bandai Namco has announced a renewal of the Aikatsu series named Aikatsu
    Stars, thereby axeing about 20 characters from the original series and thus
    making everyone butthurt. However, after watching the preview, I can certify
    that Aikatsu Stars will be Probably At Least As Good As Aikatsu. Also Nijino
    Yume is best idol.
