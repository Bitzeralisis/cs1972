1) CONTROLS. ___________________________________________________________________

	SHOOT  > (LMB) or [S]
	DEFEND > [W]
	


2) MECHANICS. __________________________________________________________________

	COMBO SYSTEM.

		The diamonds around the reticle is your combo, and your score gain is
		multiplied by your combo. Each time you shoot on the beat, your combo
		goes up by 1. If you shoot off the beat, or hold the shoot button, your
		combo will slowly decrease. Mantain a full combo to get a high score!


	DEFENSE SYSTEM.

		Currently in a very rough state, much of it is going to change in the
		upcoming weeks. For now, enemy projectiles have a hexagonal ring
		overlaid on them. When the arrows in the ring line up, press the defend
		button to block it. (There isn't any feedback for blocking properly
		yet, but then again you can't die either so it doesn't really matter.)
