                      CHAPTER ZERO: ATTACK OF ROBOCYLINDER

1) OVERVIEW. ___________________________________________________________________

    GRASSDASH
    CHAPTER ZERO: ATTACK OF ROBOCYLINDER

    The FOUR TRIBES once lived in peace on the S.S. GALAXY INFINITY GRASS PLANE
    LAND WORLDTOPIA.  Then, ROBOCYLINDER attacked.

    But a hero appeared: the GRASSDASHER, a charmingly cylindrical
    GRASS-MAN-CYLINDER, honed in the arts of DASH. Using the secret technique
    known only as "collision check," or "collide" for short, the GRASSDASHER
    must defeat ROBOCYLINDER to restore peace to the S.S. GALAXY INFINITY GRASS
    PLANE LAND WORLDTOPIA.


2) HOW TO PLAY. ________________________________________________________________

    Defeat ROBOCYLINDER by colliding into it!

    In order to reach ROBOCYLINDER, the GRASSDASHER must use DASH-JUMP in order
    to jump up higher and higher FLOATING GRASS CIRCULOPLATFORMs. However, the
    GRASSDASHER can only DASH in short bursts at a time. Keep an eye on the
    DASH BAR and slow down to recover it!

    ROBOCYLINDER will attempt to stop the GRASSDASHER by firing RED DOOM
    CYLINDERs. Should the GRASSDASHER collide with a RED DOOM CYLINDER, he will
    take damage to his LIFE GAUGE. If the GRASSDASHER's LIFE GAUGE is completely
    depleted, he will be defeated.

4) ALEX'S IDOL CORNER. _________________________________________________________

    According to some taxonomists, Nico Yazawa belongs to the "best idol"
    genus. However, other taxonomists claim she is a member of the "trash"
    genus, a very close relative of the "best idol" genus.
