2) ALEX'S IDOL CORNER. _________________________________________________________

	Child of Eden was actually about saving an "idol" of sorts named Lumi. Lumi
	was the first human to live their entire life in space, and could only
	connect with people of the Earth through her songs. After her death,
	scientists preserved her mind digitally, and in the future came reconstruct
	her persona in "Eden", the digital virtual reality space that replaced the
	internet. Therefore, as the first person to be born into the digital world,
	Lumi became the "Child of Eden".

	Children of Gaia is based loosely off this mythos, where the Eden system
	exists; the mother of the Eden system was named "Gaia", and those who share
	her blood (descendants of the original creators of the Gaia system) have
	amazing powers beyond those of regular people. These "Children of Gaia"
	fight for control of Eden in a war of ideals.

    SHOOTING & COMBO.

        As long as the shoot button is held, you will shoot once every 16th
        beat. After the shoot button is released, you will shoot exactly 8 more
        shots.

        Each beat, there is a chance to either increase or decrease the combo.
        One time only per beat, when the shoot button is pressed: if the shoot
        button was pressed with perfect timing, then the combo increases by 1,
        and if the shoot button was pressed without perfect timing, then combo
        decreases by 1. Also, if the shoot button was not pressed during the
        beat, then combo decreases by 1 if it has been more than one beat since
        the shoot button was pressed with perfect timing.
