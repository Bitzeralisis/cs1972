3) STORY. ______________________________________________________________________

    After travelling through many worlds and honing hir chaos powers, the
    GRASSDASHER has reached the helm of ROBOCYLINDER's DIMENSIONAL SPACESHIP.
    With the existence of the multiverse at stake, the GRASSDASHER must defeat
    ROBOCYLINDER and take back the CHAOS CRYSTALS before it is too late.

    PROF. POACEAE's TIP:

        "Hey GRASSDASHER! Watch out for ROBOCYLINDER's DOOM-MINIONS! They pack
         quite the punch, but they're also very fragile! ROBOCYLINDER's powers
         are limited, and it can only command a small number of them at once.
         Try trapping them somewhere while you fight ROBOCYLINDER!"


4) ALEX'S IDOL CORNER. _________________________________________________________

    Aikatsu Stars, the reboot of the Aikatsu series, starts coming out in two
    days. I highly recommend the Aikatsu series to anyone who wants a fresh
    take on 2D idols. Please look forward to it!
