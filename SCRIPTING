                                   Scripting

1) SYNTAX. _____________________________________________________________________

    COG scripts consist of a list of instructions delimited by newlines, where
    an instruction is a list of arguments delimited by whitespace.

    At the base level, a (listof behavior-definition) is expected.


2) INSTRUCTION CLASSES (GLOBAL). _______________________________________________

    behavior-definition:
    
        behavior-definition: def (behavior-name: string) \ (body: listof action) \ end
    
            There are two special behaviors in COG scripts: the "none" behavior
            (which has no actions), which is defined automatically, and the
            "main" behavior, which needs to be defined, and is given to the
            level controller at the start of the level. Behaviors cannot be
            redefined and if a behavior-name is given for a previously defined
            behavior, a warning is raised (and the entire body of the behavior
            is invalidated).


    action:
    
        (beat: float) (action-inner)
        q (beat: float) (action-inner)

            Perform an action on beat.
            
            In the second form, the game performs the action immediately even
            if the current time is earlier than beat. For some actions, this
            has the effect of "queueing" that action to automatically perform
            in the future. For other actions, it will perform now regardless of
            the beat value. Finally, some actions will cause undefined
            behavior.

            All play actions are recommended to be q'd in order to pre-load it
            and prevent lag when the music needs to be played. spawn and shoot
            can be safely q'd. All other action-inner are unspecified and not
            recommended to be q'd.


    action-inner:

        disappear

            Causes the entity to delete itself.

        set (attribute)

        spawn (enemy-type: string) (behavior-name: string) (initializer: listof attribute)

            By default, the spawned enemy's spatial attributes are equal to the
            spawner's.

        play (file: string) (bpm: float) (offset: float) (loop-start: float) (loop-end: float)

            Plays file as a bgm. For seamless transitioning, this is preferred
            to be used with "q".

    attribute:

        pos (relative-type) (x: float-nil) (y: float-nil) (z: float-nil)
        vel (relative-type) (x: float-nil) (y: float-nil) (z: float-nil)
        acc (relative-type) (x: float-nil) (y: float-nil) (z: float-nil)

            These three attributes are a special class of attribute known as
            spatial attributes. relative-type is either "abs" or "rel" and
            float-nils are either regular numbers or ".", which means that
            dimension should be ignored (so that just x-position can be set, for
            example, with "pos abs 0 . .".
        

    relative-type:

        abs
        rel


    float-nil: 

        .
        (float)

3) INSTRUCTION CLASSES: CONTROLLER. ____________________________________________

    These are instructions that only the controller (which runs the main
    behavior) may perform.


4) INSTRUCTION CLASSES: ENEMY. _________________________________________________

    These are instructions that only enemies may perform.

    action-inner:

        shoot (travel-time: float) (shot-type: int) (lane: int) (*: pos) (*: vel)

            May only be performed by enemies.

            Note that although * are spatial attributes, in the case of shoot
            their arguments x, y, and z may not be . or it will result in
            undefined behavior.


    attribute:

        targetable (float)


5) ERRORS AND WARNINGS. ________________________________________________________

    Whenever something unexpected shows up while parsing a script, either an
    error or a warning is thrown. In the case of an error, the entire script
    becomes invalid. In the case of a warning, generally it invalidates the
    entire instruction recursively, stopping at a listof.
